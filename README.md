# Covid-Data

## Project Overview

In this data analysis project I was curious on how different places in the world were being affected by covid. The data could be used to compare responses by different countries to see what may or may not have helped in the response. 


### Data Source

The data set used for this analysis can be found on " https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths " though it is a bit outdated at this point. The link also has their own helpful charts to visualize the data.


### Tools

- Excel - Data familiarization
- MySQL - Data Analysis
- Tableau - Creating visualization


### Exploratory Data Analysis 

- Which countries had a better response once someone contracted covid? 
- Which countries were unable to slow the spread of covid? 
- Which countries had a higher vaccination count? And could it have contributed to saving lives? 
- Which countries had the highest percentage of deaths in their population?
